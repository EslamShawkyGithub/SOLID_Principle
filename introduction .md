SOLID Principle of Object Oriented Design:

  
  
   S - Single-responsiblity principle >> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
   
   O - Open-closed principle >> Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
  
   L - Liskov substitution principle
    
   I - Interface segregation principle >> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't                              be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
    
   D - Dependency Inversion Principle >> Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
