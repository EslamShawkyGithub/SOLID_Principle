# SOLID_Principle
SOLID Principle of object oriented design with Dart language 
S.O.L.I.D stands for:
When expanded the acronyms might seem complicated, but they are pretty simple to grasp.
S - Single-responsiblity principle >>> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
O - Open-closed principle >>> Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
L - Liskov substitution principle >>> Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
I - Interface segregation principle >>> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
D - Dependency Inversion Principle >>> Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
